### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WEBY.git
Create a MySQL database:

Open PhpMyAdmin (usually http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
Create a new database, e.g., weby_db.
Configure database connection:

Copy the .env.example file to .env.

Update the database configuration in the .env file:

   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=weby_db
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
```
Install dependencies and migrate the database:
